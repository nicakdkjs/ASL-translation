# UOL CM3070 Final Year Project - Real Time Sign Language Translation

## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
This is my personal project for UOL CM3070 Final Year Project Submission.

This project involves translating sign language gestures into coherent sentences and audible speech by orchestrating multiple AI models. The solution leverages pre-trained models to detect gesture and recognize sign language, sentence-construction models to form meaningful sentences from detected words, and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine to produce clear auditory outputs.

This project is still in progress.

## <a name="gesture-recognition"></a> Gesture Recognition
The project uses gesture recogition model that recognises ASL. the model used is by https://github.com/209sontung/sign-language

## <a name="setence-construction"></a> Sentence Construction
The project uses sentence construction. The model used is

## <a name="text-to-speech"></a> Text To Speech
This project uses text to speech. The model used is
